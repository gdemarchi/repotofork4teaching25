# repotofork4teaching25
Short dummy repo used for teaching purposes.

Try to fork it (online), clone it locally on your computer, copy the file present there, modify the content, and save it as helloWorldNN.m (NN are your initials). Then push it upstream, and try to open a PR (Pull Request) with my original repo. If your file lands in my repo you'll get a "sehr gut" :-)
